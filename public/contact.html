    <h1>How to contact me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Due to the nature of my job, I'm mostly abroad and cannot be always easily located. Still, here are some ways you can try to contact me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Contracts on notice Boards. If I happen to be in the region and you're interested in my services, we'll probable come in contact this way.</li>
        <li>Temple of Melitele. You can try and leave your message there. Ask for Priestess Nenneke. </li>
        <li>Cabaret of Rosemary and Thyme, Novigrad. Ask for Dandelion.</li>
        <li>Kaer Morhen, Kaedwen. Occasionally during the Winter Season.</li>
    </ul>
